# Sockeye

Reconnecting Websocket Client Library for Clojure


## Description

Sockeye is a standalone reconnectiong websocket client for Clojure. It's based on [Tyrus](https://tyrus-project.github.io), a reference implementation of [javax.websockets](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/websocket/package-summary.html) API. It supports automatic reconnecting on disconnects and failures.

***Warning:*** This is work in progress, and API is subject to change until version 1.0.

## Usage

### Dependency

Latest version: `0.1.0-alpha`
Note: not yet released to clojars

deps.edn:
```clj
ogimart/sockeye {:mvn/version "0.1.0-alpha"}
```

leiningen:
```clj
:dependencies [[ogimart/sockeye "0.1.0-alpha"]]
```

maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>ogimart</groupId>
  <artifactId>sockeye</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-alpha</version>
</dependency>
```

### Minimal example:
```clojure
(require '[ogimart/sockeye.core :refer :all])

(def url "ws://localhost:9090")
(def clt (client))
(def listener (event-handler {:on-open (fn [sess]
                                         (println "connected"))
                              :on-close (fn [code reason]
                                          (println "connection closed:" code reason))
                              :on-text (fn [msg]
                                         (println msg))}))

(def session (connect url clt listener))
(send-text session "text message")
(disconnect session)
```
